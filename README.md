### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently doing my PhD at University of Nevada, Reno, in the dept. of Computer Science and Technology.  I did my Bachelor's from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh and Master's from 
Tsinghua University, China. 

My research interest lies in Computer Vision and Precision Agriculture.

I like to read books, travel, watch cartoons, anime and explore interesting food.
